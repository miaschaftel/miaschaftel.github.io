            <!--<p class="lead">I’ve always been drawn to moments that feel lived in.</p>-->
            <p>I’m drawn to moments that feel authentic—the kind that happen when people are comfortable, present, and not trying too hard. Those moments shape how I think about creativity, design, and the experiences we remember long after they’re over.</p>
            <p>My work sits at the intersection of nostalgia and the present. I’m inspired by places and settings that bring people together and by the energy that emerges when things feel effortless and genuine. I care deeply about connection, and about creating visuals and experiences that feel warm, intuitive, and human rather than overly polished or performative.</p>
            <p>I’m a creative designer based in New York City with a background in user experience design from the University of Michigan. I’ve worked across industries including luxury fashion retail, global hospitality, consumer packaged goods, and financial technology, collaborating with teams to shape thoughtful, visually grounded experiences. While much of my work lives in digital spaces, my approach is informed by a broader interest in craft, storytelling, and how people interact with the world around them.</p>
            <p>Outside of client work, I spend time exploring creativity through photography, embroidery, jewelry making, painting, writing, improv, and video. Working across mediums helps me stay curious and intentional in my practice. </p>
            <p> I’m most energized when I can explore creative practices and collaborate with others to bring ideas to life in a way that feels thoughtful, authentic, and memorable.</p>
